Twitter_500m.tif: This image was produced by all the geo-tagged tweets posted in the contiguous United States between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. The spatial resolution is 0.00416° (~500 m).

Twitter_1000m.tif: This image was produced by all the geo-tagged tweets posted in the contiguous United States between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. The spatial resolution is 0.00833° (~1000 m).

Upsampled_DMSP.tif: This is a refined DMSP-OLS stable lights image for 2013 with a spatial resolution of 0.00416° × 0.00416°. Blooming effects have been greatly reduced and DN values of saturated pixels were adjusted by the Twitter_500m and Twitter_1000m images.

The folder of Twitter_2014_monthly: This folder saves 12 tweet images with a spatial resolution of 0.00416° × 0.00416° for 12 months of 2014. 

Methods producing these images have been described in the paper “N. Zhao, W. Zhang, Y. Liu, E.L. Samson, Y. Chen, G. Cao. Improving nighttime lights imagery with location-based social media data. IEEE Transactions on Geosciences and Remote Sensing.”
